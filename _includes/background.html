      I'm currently a Student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.nycu.edu.tw/" target="_blank">National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University</a> pursuing Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I will start to work at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.synopsys.com/" target="_blank">Synopsys</a> as a Intern in this Summer.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
